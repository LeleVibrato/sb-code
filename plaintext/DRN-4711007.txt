The complaint
Mrs C complains that upon surrender of her whole of life policy, Liverpool Victoria Financial Services Limited (LV) paid her less than originally quoted because of changes to the method in calculating the value of the policy. Mrs C is being represented in her complaint, but for ease I will refer to all action as being hose of Mrs C. 
What happened
Mrs C was contacted by LV in October 2021 about a whole of life with profits policy which was taken out in 1978. In March 2022 the surrender value was confirmed at 14,501.74 but she decided not to surrender this until October 2022 by which point the value had dropped. She was informed in December 2022 that the surrender value had dropped to around 8,900. So, she complained to LV about the delays she encountered between requesting the surrender to being given the valuation around two months later. She says LV took twenty-five days to begin the surrender process on 31 October 2022, then was told they needed a marriage certificate to confirm Mrs C's change of name and later also requested Mrs C's authority to add her son as her representative. This process wasn't completed until 17 February 2023. In addition to complaining about the delays and the impact this may have had on the valuation, Mrs C also says the reason the value had dropped was because LV had changed the way they were calculating surrender values for these types of policies. She was later told in a call with LV on 27 January 2023, that any higher prices would have been honoured until November 2022. Mrs C says she never received any communications about a change in the way the policy surrender values were being calculated or that a deadline applied to the surrender valuation. To resolve the complaint, she says the policy surrender value in March 2022 should be honoured and the remainder of around 5,600 should be paid to her. In their final response letter in March 2022, LV agreed to pay 150 for the distress and inconvenience caused by the delays and errors made. They did not agree to increase the surrender value as they say the complete documentation to confirm the surrender was received in December 2022, as such the valuation was taken from this date. They also say they were within rights to make a commercial decision to change the way they calculated the value of policies as their approach was fair to all customers. They say they were not obliged to give Mrs C advance notice of these changes. Unsatisfied with this response, Mrs C brought her complaint to this service. An investigator here considered the complaint and didn't uphold it. He said LV had accepted and paid 150 for the errors made and this was reasonable. He didn't think they'd done anything wrong in calculating the surrender value and agreed with LV that they didn't need to give Mrs C prior notice of any changes. As Mrs C didn't agree with the investigator, this came to me for a decision. 
What I've decided and why
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what's fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
