The complaint
Mrs S complains about the service she received from Domestic & General Insurance Plc (D&G) after she made a claim under her television insurance policy. 
What happened
Mrs S has a television insurance policy underwritten by D&G. This provides cover for her television in the event of a breakdown or accidental damage. In January 2024, Mrs S contacted D&G to report that her television was losing signal and turning off randomly. D&G arranged for one of their repair agents to investigate. Following the inspection, Mrs S contacted D&G to find out what was happening with her claim, this is because she'd received a text from D&G's repair agent saying her claim wasn't covered. But Mrs S said that the repair agent had advised her replacement parts would be ordered. She also said that she was told that she would receive a replacement television and hers would be written off. D&G looked into things and checked with their repair agent. However, they advised that no fault had been found with the television during the visit and they were unable to replicate the reported issue, so they said there wasn't a valid claim for either a repair or a replacement. As Mrs S remained unhappy, a second inspection was carried out by a repair agent of D&G from a different company, but they were also unable to locate a fault with the television. Therefore D&G maintained that the television wouldn't be replaced. As Mrs S remained unhappy, she approached the Financial Ombudsman Service. One of our investigators looked into things but she didn't uphold the complaint. She said that two visits had been carried out and the reported fault didn't present during those visits. Therefore, as no fault had been found in those visits, she didn't think D&G were acting unfairly by not replacing or repairing the television. The investigator said that if Mrs S obtains her own report that diagnoses the issue, she can submit that to D&G to consider. The investigator said that the engineer notes didn't reflect that a part would be ordered, or the television would be written off and replaced as Mrs S says. And even if Mrs S had been incorrectly told this, the investigator said she wouldn't expect D&G to do this without a fault identified. The investigator also noted Mrs S was unhappy her appointment had been changed, but she thought it was carried out promptly after and didn't cause inconvenience. So, the investigator didn't recommend D&G do anything further. Mrs S didn't agree so the case was passed to me for a final decision. 
What I've decided and why
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what's fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, whilst I appreciate it'll come as a disappointment to Mrs S, I've reached the same outcome as our investigator. Mrs S' policy with D&G provides cover (subject to terms and conditions) for breakdown and accidental damage to her television. Mrs S reported to D&G that her television would randomly lose signal and turn off. However, two different repair agents from separate companies were appointed by D&G to investigate, and neither was able to identify any faults or replicate the reported issues. In the absence of this, I wouldn't expect D&G to write off and replace Mrs S' television without evidence of a fault (breakdown or accidental damage) that would be covered under her policy. As neither agent was able to replicate the reported issue or establish a fault, I don't think D&G has acted unfairly by not writing off or replacing Mrs S' television under her insurance policy after the two repair agent visits. However, if Mrs S is able to obtain her own report, or evidence of the issues, she should submit this to D&G for consideration. But based on what I've seen, I don't think they acted unfairly. Mrs S also says she was told first that a replacement part would be ordered, and then that her television would be written off and replaced. However, I've been unable to establish that based on all the information provided. Even if Mrs S was given incorrect advice that her television would be replaced, which I'm not persuaded has been evidenced, I don't think D&G would be acting unfairly by then not replacing the television given no fault was identified in the two repair agent visits. With the above in mind, I don't think D&G acted unfairly by declining to write off or replace Mrs S' television following the two repair agent inspections. I also recognise Mrs S is unhappy the original provisional appointment date was moved to two days later. However, this was rearranged promptly, and from what I understand, the moving of the appointment didn't cause significant inconvenience. 
My final decision
It's my final decision that I don't uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I'm required to ask Mrs S to accept or reject my decision before 4 July 2024.
