The complaint
Mr B is unhappy that AWP P&C S. A. declined a claim he made on his travel insurance policy and because he says the policy terms are unclear. 
What happened
Mr B became unwell whilst travelling abroad and received medical treatment. Mr B claimed on his travel insurance policy for his expenses. AWP declined the claim as they said Mr B had been on a trip which was in excess of the maximum duration allowed, which was 31 days. Mr B complained to AWP but they maintained their decision was fair and in line with the policy terms. Unhappy, Mr B complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Our investigator looked into what happened and thought that AWP had acted fairly. Mr B didn't agree and asked an ombudsman to review the complaint. In summary, he says that the incident which gave rise to the claim started within the first 31 days of the trip. And he didn't think the policy made it clear that there was a limit on the duration of the trip. So, the complaint was passed to me to make a decision. 
What I've decided and why
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what's fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. The relevant rules and industry guidelines say that AWP has a responsibility to handle claims promptly and fairly and they shouldn't reject a claim unreasonably. The policy terms and conditions say: On page one of the insurance product information document (IPID) it says, Are there any restrictions on cover' and: There is a limit on the length of a trip that can be covered. On page five of the policy booklet, Journey limits', it says: Cover is for short trips of 31 days or less per trip only. There is absolutely no cover offered by this policy whatsoever for trips which are longer than the 31 days per trip. This would include not insuring you for any part of a trip that is longer than 31 days in duration. I'm very sorry to read of the circumstances which led to Mr B to seek treatment whilst abroad. I have a lot of empathy for the circumstances he's described. However, I'm not upholding this complaint because: I think the IPID and the policy documents make it adequately clear that there is a limit on the duration of a trip. It's referred to in the policy summary and I think it was for Mr B to review the policy documentation to make sure it met his needs. If Mr B is unhappy with how the policy was presented during the sales process he'll need to make a complaint to the seller of the policy. Mr B was admitted to hospital after the 31 day trip limit had passed. Therefore, on a strict application of the policy terms there is no cover for the expenses he incurred. So, I think AWP has fairly declined the claim in line with the policy terms and conditions. I've considered whether it is fair and reasonable to depart from a strict application of the policy terms in the circumstances of this case. However, I don't think it is. Mr B's admission to hospital was considerably later than the 31 days expired. And, although he may well have been experiencing some symptoms during the first 31 days of the trip, I think it is reasonable to conclude that the event which gave rise to the claim was the admission to hospital as that is the point at which AWP are expected to accept liability for expenses. So, I'm not persuaded that it is fair and reasonable to uphold the complaint in such circumstances. 
My final decision
I'm not upholding this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I'm required to ask Mr B to accept or reject my decision before 5 July 2024.
