The complaint
Mr and Mrs C complain about the way Accredited Insurance (Europe) Ltd (Accredited) has handled a claim made under their home insurance policy. Any references to Accredited in this decision include its appointed agents. 
What happened
In January 2023, there was a fire in Mr and Mrs C's garage, which caused significant damage to the stored contents. Mr and Mrs C contacted their insurer, Accredited, to make a claim. Over the subsequent months, Mr and Mrs C say they encountered numerous challenges with the claim, and that despite providing the requested documentation, were given an inadequate settlement offer, which was not in line with the new for old terms of their policy. They also said the settlement offer didn't cover the full value of the beyond economic repair list of items, which had been validated by the insurer, its loss adjuster and contractors and that the insurer's demands for extensive documentation for items under 50 for example, were unreasonable and have unfairly delayed the resolution of the claim. Mr and Mrs C have said this has had a profound impact on them, both financially and emotionally. Mr and Mrs C complained that Accredited hadn't handled the claim fairly, and also complained about the way Accredited had dealt with a data subject access request (DSAR) that they'd made. Accredited responded to Mr and Mrs C's complaints, saying it wouldn't be able to offer the full settlement for their contents unless Mr and Mrs C provided evidence to substantiate each individual item. Accredited also said that whilst Mr and Mrs C were understandably disappointed with its response to the DSAR, Accredited did not have access to the requested information. Because Mr and Mrs C remained unhappy with Accredited's response, they referred their complaint to this service. Our investigator considered the complaint and thought it should be upheld. She said it wasn't reasonable for Accredited to ask for proof of ownership for everything being claimed for. And that it should pay Mr and Mrs C 100 compensation for the inconvenience they experienced when their DSAR wasn't passed on to the right place promptly. But that it should also pay them an additional 300 for the way it had handled their claim. Accredited thought the 100 compensation was fair, but didn't agree fully with the remainder of our investigator's assessment about the contents. It said that whilst it could accept increasing the threshold for undocumented items from 50 to anything up to 150 in value, the policy specifically outlined that higher value items would require validation. It said that it believed it had made a fair and reasonable offer in light of this. As Accredited didn't agree with our investigator's view, the complaint has now been passed to me to decide. 
What I've decided and why
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what's fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I'm upholding this complaint. I'll explain why. Accredited says Mr and Mrs C have presented a claim for just over 33,000. Of this, it says it has paid Mr and Mrs C an interim settlement of 25,000 despite only agreeing to around 13,000 worth of the claimed items on the loss list. I'm satisfied that Accredited's agreement to increase the threshold of the items not requiring validation from 50 to 150 is fair and reasonable. This is because I don't consider it practical or realistic to expect a policyholder to have access to proof of ownership for every item they own, particularly items of lower value. Many people do not retain receipts and invoices over long periods of time or at all, and this doesn't necessarily mean that they don't own the items or can't evidence that ownership in a different way. Mr and Mrs C live on a smallholding, so the prevalence of certain items such as large gardening and agricultural equipment would not be unusual. I think the higher value items Mr and Mrs C claimed for are consistent with their other contents and their overall lifestyle, so I don't think it's reasonable to insist on further proof of ownership for those items, over and above what Mr and Mrs C are able to provide. For example, Mr and Mrs C have provided various pieces of evidence to demonstrate their ownership of the rotavator. This includes images showing messages from the person from whom they bought the rotavator, which Accredited has said it cannot accept as proof, as the messages cannot be validated. I think Accredited could do more here and undertake additional enquiries in order to check the legitimacy of the messages. Accredited has said it will liaise with the insured and keep the option to validate the rotavator open. But I don't think this is enough to satisfy Mr and Mrs C that Accredited is treating them fairly. I say this because the rotavator is a high value item, and the policy says proof of ownership is required for these. But I also note that in a letter dated 11 July 2023, in which Mr and Mrs C are asked to provide further information, Accredited's agents state: Any documentation regarding this item will be useful such as invoices, photos, owner's manual or servicing records. The word or suggests that not all the evidence on the list is required, and because it says any documentation provided will be useful, this indicates that evidence like photos which Mr and Mrs C have provided will be fairly considered, particularly where the item was identifiable in the debris and is consistent with the owner's lifestyle. So whilst it is reasonable for Accredited to ask for evidence of ownership, and the onus is on a policyholder to prove their claim, I don't consider it fair or reasonable for Accredited not to accept evidence other than receipts or invoices to demonstrate proof of ownership in this case. As Mr and Mrs C have provided photos of the rotavator and messages from the person who sold it to them, I consider a fair resolution to this part of the claim would be for Accredited to conduct further enquiries to satisfy itself that the messages from the seller are genuine and then accept the claim for this item. The lawn mower should also be included as I can see that a Ride on mower is listed in the section Other items on the fixtures and fittings list, dating back to when Mr and Mrs C purchased the property in 2020. I think this is sufficient evidence to prove ownership of a high value item which is visible in photos and which Accredited has accepted was identifiable in the debris. Accredited has said that for high value items, the policy says that the bought price and evidence of ownership is required. But I don't think it's fair in this case to apply a strict interpretation of what that evidence might include, when there is other persuasive evidence of ownership. There's also no evidence for me to conclude, as Accredited has suggested, that the items may not have been in working order at the time of the fire. I think in this case, Mr and Mrs C have provided all they can in relation to the high value items, so their submissions should be considered fairly and the claim for those items reconsidered in line with the remaining policy terms. The policy also says that if no equivalent replacement is available then Accredited will pay the full replacement cost of the item with no discount applied. Accredited has suggested that second-hand replacements should be sourced but this isn't in line with the policy terms where replacements aren't available. Under the terms of the policy, Mr and Mrs C are therefore entitled to the full replacement cost of the items. In relation to the DSAR made by Mr and Mrs C, agents acting on behalf of Accredited received this request but failed to pass it on to Accredited, instead asking Mr and Mrs C to contact Accredited directly. I'm satisfied that Accredited should have been passed the DSAR sooner by its appointed agents. And because the agents were acting on behalf of Accredited, I consider Accredited to be responsible for the delays in the handling of the DSAR. I therefore consider it fair and reasonable for Accredited to pay Mr and Mrs C 100 in compensation for the inconvenience this caused. I also think Accredited should pay Mr and Mrs C compensation for the distress and inconvenience it has caused throughout the claim when it has repeatedly asked Mr and Mrs C for proof of ownership for each item they've claimed for. I don't consider this reasonable or good industry practice for the reasons I've given above, and I acknowledge that this has caused Mr and Mrs C a great deal of upset, for which they should be compensated. I think a fair amount of compensation to reflect the distress they've experienced, bearing in mind the time things have taken and the impact this has had on Mr and Mrs C, is 300 bringing the total amount of compensation in this case to 400. Putting things right Accredited Insurance (Europe) Ltd must now: Provide Mr and Mrs C with a full breakdown of how the 25,000 settlement figure for the contents has been reached, if it has not already provided this. Reconsider the claim in line with the remaining policy terms, for the items not already included in the settlement, which are under 150 in value, without requiring proof of ownership or value. Reconsider the claim in line with the remaining policy terms, for any items which were burned and where debris was evident and where the items remained identifiable. This includes the rotavator and lawn mower. Accredited should accept reasonable evidence of proof of ownership for those items, such as evidence from the sellers of the items and photographic/video evidence of the items. Pay Mr and Mrs C a total of 400 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused during this claim. It may deduct from this figure any compensation already paid to Mr and Mrs C for distress and inconvenience. Add 8% simple interest per annum on any additional payments made to Mr and Mrs C, from the date the 25,000 interim payment was made until the date of settlement. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I direct Accredited Insurance (Europe) Ltd to put things right as I've set out above. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I'm required to ask Mr C and Mrs C to accept or reject my decision before 7 July 2024.
